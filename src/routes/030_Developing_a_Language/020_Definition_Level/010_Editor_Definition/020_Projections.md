# Projections
In the `.edit` file a *projection* is defined between angular brackets.
This is done in a style similar from markdown, what you see looks close to what you get.
Everything within the square brackets (`[]`), except
the parts surrounded by `${}`, is taken literally.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-indentation.edit#L6-L14

Text {
[
This is
        literal text
      that is projected in the
                editor
  for every concept of type Text.
]
}
```

## Including Properties
When you define a projection for a concept or interface, you will want to include its properties. For
this you need to use the special notation `${}`. This tells ProjectIt to include a property, according to the projection
that is defined for the type of the property.

In the following example `self.body` is a property of type `DocuExpression`.
It will be projected according to the projection for `DocuExpression`, whereas `self.declaredType`
is a property of type `DocuType`, which is abstract. This property
will be projected according to the definition for the (non-abstract) subtype of `DocuType` that is 
currently found.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-main-default.edit#L40-L46

CalcFunction {
    [
        ${name} ( ${parameters horizontal separator[,]} ): ${declaredType} {
            ${body}
        }
    ]
}
```

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header">Only direct properties are allowed</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
Only the properties that are directly owned by the concept or interface are allowed. For instance,
<code>self.declaredType.name</code> is not a valid property projection. 
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>


<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header"><code>self</code> is optional</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
Because you may only use direct properties, the prefix <code>self</code> may be omitted. 
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>


### <a name="named_projection"></a> Including a Property Projection from Another Editor
Normally, the property that you include will be displayed according to the projection of its type. This projection 
will be found by ProjectIt using the [ordering](/030_Developing_a_Language/020_Definition_Level/010_Editor_Definition/010_Edit_Files#ordering)
as defined in the configuration. 

When you specifically want to use another projection, you can use a **named property projection**. In that case, 
ProjectIt will use the projection defined for the concept in the editor with the specified name.

In this example, the projection for `self.parts` will first be searched in the editor named `comments`.
If it cannot be found, the normal ordering of projections will proceed.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-specials.edit#L3-L9

BaseProduct {[
    /* In this projection 'self.parts' is always shown according to the projection */
    /* defined for concept InsurancePart in the editor 'comments'.                 */
    Base Products ${self.name} for ${self.theme}
        ${self.parts:comments}
]}

```

## Lists
If a property is a list, you can indicate whether it should be projected horizontally or vertically.
Both keywords are optional. If neither of `vertical` or `horizontal` is present, the property will be displayed as
a vertical list.

You can also choose to project a list property as a [table](/030_Developing_a_Language/020_Definition_Level/010_Editor_Definition#tables).
However, its default projection will always be a list. This is the one that will be generated when a 
projection is not present in the `.edit` files.

In a list, you can add one of the following.
* A *separator* string, which will be shown in between all elements.
* A *terminator* string, which will be shown after each element.
* An *initiator* string, which will be shown before every element of the list. 

Each is optional. The default is a single space used as separator.

In the following example the list `parts` is displayed vertically with the string `';'` as terminator.
Whereas, the list `themes` is displayed horizontally with the string `', '` as separator. Finally, the
list `helpers` is shown as a vertical list without any separator, terminator or initiator. Actually, we 
could omit the keyword `vertical`, because this is the default projection for lists.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-main-default.edit#L27-L38

InsuranceProduct {[
    Insurance Product ${name} ( public name: ${productName} ) USES ${basedOn horizontal separator[, ]}
        Themes: ${themes horizontal separator[, ]}
        Premium: ${advertisedPremium} per ${nrPremiumDays}
        Insured risks:
            ${parts vertical terminator [;]}
        Calculation
            [? Risk adjusted by = ${riskAdjustment} ]
            calculated premium: ${calculation}
        [?Helper functions:
            ${helpers vertical}]
]}
```

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header">Newlines in terminator or separator are ignored</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
A terminator or separator should not contain a newline character. Horizontal or vertical layout is
purely determined by the keywords <code>horizontal</code> and <code>vertical</code>.
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>

## <a name="tables"></a>Tables
If a property is a list, you can choose to project it as a table. Tables can be either row or column based.
Row based means that each element of the list is displayed in a row. Column based, obviously, means that 
each element is displayed in a single column. The default is row based. 

Defining a table is a two-step process. 
1. Add the keyword `table` to the list property that
you want to display as a table. Optionally, add one of the keywords `rows` or `columns`.
2. Add a table-projection to the type of the property. The table-projection defines
the headers of the table and which parts of the list elements are displayed in which row or column.

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
Note that you only need to include one
table projection for both column and row based tables. ProjectIt will swap the entries when needed.
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>

For example, to project the `parts` property of concept `BaseProduct` as a row based table, you can use the following code.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-tables.edit#L13-L16

BaseProduct {[
    Base Products ${name} for ${theme}
        ${parts table rows}
]}
```

Given the above example, there should also be a projection tagged `table` for the concept `InsurancePart`. 
Below four columns/rows are defined, each with its own header. 

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-tables.edit#L6-L11

InsurancePart{
table [
    Name    | risk               | pay out          | is approved
    ${name} | ${statisticalRisk} | ${maximumPayOut} | ${isApproved}
]
}
```

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header">Properties within a table are displayed according to their own projection</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
The manner in which each of the properties of a single function are displayed, will be determined
by their own projections. In this example, `self.parameters` is a list, and will be displayed as another table.
The inner table will be row-based, as this is the default.
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header">Whitespace in headers is ignored</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
The whitespace between the headers is not needed. However, for clarity, it is probably
good style to align the column/row-separators.
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>

## Optional Projections

When a property is marked optional in the language structure definition (the `.ast` files), the projection
of this property should also be optional. This is indicated by `[?`. 

In the next example both the property `riskAdjustment` and `helpers` are only shown if they are present. 
If they are not present, respectively the text `Risk adjusted by =` or `Helper functions:` is omitted as well.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-main-default.edit#L27-L38

InsuranceProduct {[
    Insurance Product ${name} ( public name: ${productName} ) USES ${basedOn horizontal separator[, ]}
        Themes: ${themes horizontal separator[, ]}
        Premium: ${advertisedPremium} per ${nrPremiumDays}
        Insured risks:
            ${parts vertical terminator [;]}
        Calculation
            [? Risk adjusted by = ${riskAdjustment} ]
            calculated premium: ${calculation}
        [?Helper functions:
            ${helpers vertical}]
]}
```

Note that optional projections for non-optional properties are not allowed.

## Boolean Keyword Projections
The next example shows the special manner in which properties of type **boolean** can be 
projected. The concept `Entity` has a simple property of type boolean called `isCompany`. Normally,
its value would be displayed according to the boolean keyword projection in the default editor.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/language-extras.ast#L34-L37

concept Entity {
    isCompany: boolean;
    name: identifier;
    reference baseEntity?: Entity;
```
```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-main-default.edit#L5-L5

boolean [YES | NO] // the strings used to display a boolean value
```

By defining that the property must be represented by a **keyword**, we can change the default. 
In the next example, the property `isCompany` will be shown as the keyword `COMPANY`. When the value
of the property is `true`, the keyword is shown. When the value is `false`, the keyword is not shown.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-main-default.edit#L57-L59

Entity {[
    ${self.isCompany [COMPANY]} ${self.name}
]}
```

This example would be displayed as one of ...

   ```
   COMPANY entity PhilipsEnterPrises { // the value of isCompany is true
     ...
   }
   entity FritsPhilips { // the value of isCompany is false
     ...
   }
   ```     

Another way to display boolean properties is to use **two** keywords. Depending on
the value of the property either the first or second keyword is shown.

```ts
// docu-project/defs/editor-specials.edit#L11-L13

    ${self.isCompany [COMPANY | PERSON]} ${self.name}
]}

```
 
This would be displayed as one of ...
   ```
   COMPANY entity PhilipsEnterPrises { // the value of isCompany is true
     ...
   }
   PERSON entity FritsPhilips { // the value of isCompany is false
     ...
   }
   ```    

<Note>
<svelte:fragment slot="header">Keywords defined within a projection overwrite the standard boolean keywords</svelte:fragment>
<svelte:fragment slot="content">
In the default editor you can define standard boolean keywords. These will not be used when either of the two keyword projections
is present.
</svelte:fragment>
</Note>
