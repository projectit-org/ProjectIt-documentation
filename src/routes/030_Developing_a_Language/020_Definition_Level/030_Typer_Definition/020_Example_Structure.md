# Generic Types: an Example Typer Definition

This example shows how generic types and unit of measurements can be defined.

## The Example Language
The language is very simple, its units consists of lists of *expression* - *declared type* pairs. Ultimately, we want to compare the declared
type with the type of the expression. Below is an example of a model unit of this language.

```text
UnitA correctExps

12 : NUMBER;
"string" : STRING;
2345: NUMBER;
"this is a large string": STRING;
true : BOOLEAN;
false: BOOLEAN;

Set{ true, true, false } : Set<BOOLEAN>;
Bag { Set { 12, 13, 14 }, Set { 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 } } : Bag<Set<NUMBER>>;

124 Meters : Meters<NUMBER>;
45 kWh : kWh<NUMBER>;
```

## The Structure Definition of the Example Language
To explain the type definition, we first need a structure definition of the example language. 
Below is the complete .ast file. But first, let's explain some highlights.

Every type in the list of *expression* - *declared type* pairs is an instance of the AST 
concept **TypeUsage**, which comes in two flavours: a type declaration,
and a type reference, that holds a reference to another AST node.

```ts
// typer-example/defs/projectY.ast#L18-L26

abstract concept TypeUsage { // to be used wherever a type can be used, either a referred type of or declared type is correct
}

concept TypeRef base TypeUsage  {
    reference type: NamedType;
}

abstract concept TypeDecl base TypeUsage {
}
```

There are also two options for a type declaration, a generic type, and a unit of measurement. For this example,
we have used the names of the generic types from the Object Constraint Language: Set, Bag, Sequence, and Collection.
Note that these declarations are part of the AST. They are not type concepts themselves.

```ts
// typer-example/defs/projectY.ast#L37-L47

concept GenericType base TypeDecl {
    baseType: TypeUsage;
    kind: GenericKind; // is it a set, sequence, bag, or anything else
}
limited GenericKind { Set; Sequence; Bag; Collection; }

concept UnitOfMeasurement base TypeDecl {
    reference baseType: PredefinedType; // is always NUMBER!!
    unit: UnitKind; // is it measured in km, kWh, grams, or anything else
}
limited UnitKind { Meters; Grams; kWh; Hours; }
```

The definitions of the expressions in the example language are straightforward. There are literal expressions for
strings, booleans, and number, as well as generic literals and unit literals.

```ts
// typer-example/defs/projectY.ast#L61-L75

expression BooleanLiteral base Exp {
    xx: boolean;
}

expression UnitLiteral base Exp {
    // 62 kilogram, or 112 miles
    inner: NumberLiteral;
    unit: UnitKind;
}

expression GenericLiteral base Exp {
    // Set{ 12, 14, 16, 18 }
    content: Exp[];
    kind: GenericKind;
}
```

## The complete Structure Definition

```ts
// typer-example/defs/projectY.ast

language projectY

model XX {
    units: XXunit[];
}

modelunit XXunit {
    lines: ExpWithType[];
    file-extension = "expr";
}

concept ExpWithType {
    expr: Exp;
    type: TypeUsage;
}

// definitions of types
abstract concept TypeUsage { // to be used wherever a type can be used, either a referred type of or declared type is correct
}

concept TypeRef base TypeUsage  {
    reference type: NamedType;
}

abstract concept TypeDecl base TypeUsage {
}

interface TopType {
}

concept NamedType implements TopType {
    name: identifier;
}

limited PredefinedType base NamedType { NUMBER; BOOLEAN; STRING; ANY; NULL; }

concept GenericType base TypeDecl {
    baseType: TypeUsage;
    kind: GenericKind; // is it a set, sequence, bag, or anything else
}
limited GenericKind { Set; Sequence; Bag; Collection; }

concept UnitOfMeasurement base TypeDecl {
    reference baseType: PredefinedType; // is always NUMBER!!
    unit: UnitKind; // is it measured in km, kWh, grams, or anything else
}
limited UnitKind { Meters; Grams; kWh; Hours; }

// definitions of expressions
abstract expression Exp {
}

expression NumberLiteral base Exp {
    xx: number;
}

expression StringLiteral base Exp {
    xx: string;
}

expression BooleanLiteral base Exp {
    xx: boolean;
}

expression UnitLiteral base Exp {
    // 62 kilogram, or 112 miles
    inner: NumberLiteral;
    unit: UnitKind;
}

expression GenericLiteral base Exp {
    // Set{ 12, 14, 16, 18 }
    content: Exp[];
    kind: GenericKind;
}


expression NamedExp base Exp {
    inner: Exp;
    myType: NamedType;
}

expression PlusExp base Exp {
    left: Exp;
    right: Exp;
}

```
