# Customization of the Editor at the API level

At the API level the editor can be changed by implementing two interfaces: 
[`PiProjection`](/060_Under_the_Hood/010_The_Editor_Framework/020_The_Editor_Interfaces/010_PiProjection_Interface) and 
[`PiAction`](/060_Under_the_Hood/010_The_Editor_Framework/020_The_Editor_Interfaces/020_PiAction_Interface). But
before you dive into all this, we suggest that you become familiar with the information
about the [ProjectIt Editor Framework](/060_Under_the_Hood/010_The_Editor_Framework).


## Learning More

You can learn how to write projections from [Writing Projections](/030_Developing_a_Language/030_API_Level/020_Writing_Projections).
How to create the action to accompany the projection can be learned from 
[Writing Actions'](/030_Developing_a_Language/030_API_Level/030_Writing_Actions).
