# Developing a Language with ProjectIt

Developing a Language with ProjectIt is usually done taking the following steps.

1. Develop the [metamodel](/030_Developing_a_Language/010_Default_Level).
2. Add the concrete syntax by adding an 
   [editor definition](/030_Developing_a_Language/020_Definition_Level/010_Editor_Definition).
3. Add scoping, typing and validation information 
   (see [ProjectIt Definition level](/030_Developing_a_Language/020_Definition_Level)).
4. Fine-tune the result on the [API level](/030_Developing_a_Language/030_API_Level).

## The Example

In this section we will be using the *Insurance* language as example. The gist of the *Insurance* language is
that it defines two types of units. One unit holds  set of parts of insurance products for a single theme, 
like 'Home', or 'Health'. This set is called a `BaseProduct`. The second contains a complete insurance 
product that consists of a number of insurance parts from one or more `BaseProducts`. This is called an 
`InsuranceProduct`.

An `InsuranceProduct` has an expression called `calculation` that describes the expected cost of this product.
To simplify this expression helpers function may be defined. Each of these is called a `CalcFunction`.

The following figure shows a UML class diagram of the concepts in the language.

We are working on a few other examples. You can find them in the `samples` folder in the
development branch of <a href="https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt" target="_blank">ProjectIt</a>.
